INVOLVED IN DE NOVO 2-containing complex involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis
PNAS 109:8374

For data analysis, only cytosines with 5x coverage in all libraries compared
were considered. DMRs were discovered using a sliding-window approach
with 200-bp window sliding at 50-bp intervals. Fisher's exact test was performed
for methylated vs. unmethylated cytosines for each context, using
the resultant windows, with FDRs estimated using a Benjamini–Hochberg
adjustment of Fisher's P values calculated in the R environment. Windows
with a FDR < 0.05 were considered for further analysis and windows within
100 bp of each other were condensed to larger regions. Regions were then
adjusted to extend to differentially methylated cytosines at each border. A
cytosine was considered differentially methylated if it showed at least
a twofold reduction in methylation percentage in the mutant. Finally regions
were also filtered to have at least 10 differentially methylated cytosines and
have an average twofold reduction in methylation percentage per cytosine.
